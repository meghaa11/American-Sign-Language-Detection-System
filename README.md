American Sign Language Recognition System is a web application that automatically detects the fingerspelling gestures signed by the user.

This application will have a webpage that will stream the live video captured from the userâ€™s webcam. In this real-time video, a blue box will be present, inside of which the user is expected to sign the alphabet they want to be interpreted. 
The application will thus take an image input from the user, containing an alphabet of the ASL. It will then proceed to classify and display the corresponding letter on the same page.

We have used python and flask.
